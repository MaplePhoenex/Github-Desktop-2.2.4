Github Desktop Windows Installer (exe)
(version 2.2.4)

Pre-Electron Update Removing Support for Windows 8.1
#screwgoogle

Installed and Ran on my system for quite a few months as i had gotten used to using it versus other ones. 
Figured id upload it here for anybody else who just might be looking for it too!


**Note** 
A Server error may appear after installing and logging in. I noticed just repeatedly hitting the 
"cancel" button on the window, about 10 or so times seemed to remove it for good. Incase anybody else also runs into this issue.
